        The Angular class binding makes it easy to add and remove a CSS class 
        conditionally. Just add [class.some-css-class]="some-condition" to 
        the element you want to style, below is the old version
    
    <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes" 
            (click)="onSelect(hero)" 
            [class.selected]="hero === selectedHero">
        <span class="badge">{{hero.id}}</span> {{hero.name}}
    </li>
    -->
    <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes">
        <a routerLink="/detail/{{hero.id}}">
            <span class="badge">{{hero.id}}</span> {{hero.name}}
        </a>
        <button class="delete" title="delete hero"
                (click)="delete(hero)">x</button>
    </li>
</ul>

    this was improved further by making it a link to another page

    this will call the hero-detail.component.ts file, using the app-hero-detail 
    selector. It then passes the selectedHeroDetails data/variable which is set to
    the selectedHero (the selectedHero data is sent by hero.component.ts)

<app-hero-detail [selectedHeroDetails]="selectedHero"></app-hero-detail>

<!-- this is the old version, not the component based version of heroDetails
     to see the old version, uncomment anything to do with selectedHero in 
     heroes.component.ts

        The word uppercase in the interpolation binding, 
        right after the pipe operator ( | ), activates the built-in UppercasePipe. 
        Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, 
        dates and other display data
    
    <h2>{{selectedHero.name | uppercase}} Details</h2>

                [(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax. 
                Here it binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox 
                so that data can flow in both directions: from the hero.name 
                property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the hero.name
            
            <input [(ngModel)]="selectedHero.name" placeholder="name" />
        </label>
