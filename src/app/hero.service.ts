/*
The HeroService could get hero data from anywhereâ€”a 
web service, local storage, or a mock data source.
Removing data access from components means you can 
change your mind about the implementation anytime, 
without touching any components. They don't know how 
the service works
*/

/*
You must make the HeroService available to the dependency 
injection system before Angular can inject it into the HeroesComponent 
by registering a provider. A provider is something that can create or 
deliver a service; in this case, it instantiates the HeroService class 
to provide the service.

To make sure that the HeroService can provide this service, register it 
with the injector, which is the object that is responsible for choosing 
and injecting the provider where the app requires it.

By default, the Angular CLI command ng generate service registers a 
provider with the root injector for your service by including provider 
metadata, that is providedIn: 'root' in the @Injectable() decorator.

When you provide the service at the root level, Angular creates a single, 
shared instance of HeroService and injects into any class that asks for it. 
Registering the provider in the @Injectable metadata also allows Angular 
to optimize an app by removing the service if it turns out not to be used 
after all
*/

/*
The @Injectable marks the class as one that participates 
in the dependency injection system. The HeroService 
class is going to provide an injectable service, 
and it can also have its own injected dependencies.
The @Injectable() decorator accepts a metadata object for 
the service, the same way the @Component() decorator did for 
your component classes

    HttpClient.get() returns the body of the response as an 
    untyped JSON object by default. Applying the optional type 
    specifier, <Hero[]> , adds TypeScript capabilities, which 
    reduce errors during compile time.

    The server's data API determines the shape of the JSON data. 
    The Tour of Heroes data API returns the hero data as an array

    To catch errors, you "pipe" the observable result from http.get() 
    through an RxJS catchError() operator

    The catchError() operator intercepts an Observable that failed. 
    It passes the error an error handler that can do what it wants 
    with the error.

    The following handleError() method reports the error and then 
    returns an innocuous result so that the application keeps working

    The HeroService methods will tap into the flow of observable 
    values and send a message, via the log() method, to the message 
    area at the bottom of the page.

    They'll do that with the RxJS tap() operator, which looks at the 
    observable values, does something with those values, and passes 
    them along. The tap() call back doesn't touch the values themselves
